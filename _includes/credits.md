[CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) is family of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology. CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the University's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). It was built following the [Lib-STATIC](https://lib-static.github.io) methodology. 

### Software and Tools Used

Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, CollectionBuilder puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic frame work is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
Data visualizations are built using the open source library [DataTables](https://datatables.net/).
